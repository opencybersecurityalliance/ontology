# OpenDXL Ontology
The OpenDXL Ontology project is focused on the development of an open and interoperable cybersecurity messaging format for use with the OpenDXL messaging bus. The ontology consists of a categorized set of messages that are used to perform actions on one or more cybersecurity products as well as notifications used to signal when significant security-related events occur. The ontology attempts to incorporate other common and open standards for message content (OpenC2, STIX, CACAO, etc.). In addition to the ontology (messaging catalog), this project also includes sample code that demonstrates how to integrate the ontology into existing security products and related solutions. The OpenDXL Standard Ontology will be offered under the Apache 2.0 license.
